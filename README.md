# PwnBox-Kali
Bash-script to automate the process of setting up a new Kali Linux virtual machine to look a like HTB PwnBox
---

Just a script to automate all the process of twiking and installing tools on new kali linux VM
<br>Some of the code was borrowed form the great work of [Dewalt-arch](https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali) on **pimpmykali**
<br> And also to automate the process of making it look a like **HTB pwnbox** based on the work of [theGuildHall](https://github.com/theGuildHall/pwnbox)
 <br>
 * `It was done mostly for me but maybe someone will find it useful`
